The code in computer programs is made of statements. Statements are the instructions for the computer to follow. Real programs can contain thousands of statements.

PRINT

The print() instruction is the easiest way to send a message to the screen or other display device.

print("Hello world.")

Numbers don't require quotation marks.

print(42)

VARIABLE

Computer programs use variables to store important information, like items in a shopping cart, prices and discounts.

The line of code below tells the computer to store information in a variable called item.

item = "bike"
nameOfVariable = "value"

Variables have a name and a value. They are connected with the equal sign =.

A variable’s name is used to identify where that information is stored. You can access the value that a variable is storing by calling its name.

budget = 200
print(budget)

STRINGS

In Python, both single ' and double " quotes can be used to define strings. It doesn’t make a difference whether you choose double or single quotation marks, but they do need to match.

movie = "Gladiator"
book = "1984"

NUMERICAL DATA

Numerical data shouldn't be in quotation marks. The line of code below declares a numerical variable

price = 10

You can perform math operations with numbers. Each print() instruction will add a value to the screen in a new line.

print(7 + 3)
