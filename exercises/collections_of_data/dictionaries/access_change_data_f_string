# Benefit of lists: allows you access data using keys instead of indexes

# dictionary = { key name: key value , key name : key value}

ACCESSING DATA USING KEYS

user = { "name":"Jon", "age":23, "pronouns": "he/him"}

print(user["name"])

CHANGE DATA INSIDE KEYS WITH INDEXING

user = { "name":"Scott", "age":23, "pronouns": "he/him"}

user["name"] = "Ramona"

COMBINING F-STRINGS WITH DICTIONARIES

myUser = {"name": "David", "age": 28}
print(f"Your name is {myUser['name']} and your age is {myUser['age']}")

# Note: you have to use single quotes (') for this technique because the double quotes (") are already being used to start and end the string
