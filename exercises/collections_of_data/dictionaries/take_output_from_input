    'color': 'red',
    'mileage': 15000
}

question = input("What key would you like to look up?: ")

print(car.get(question, "Not found"))

# Alternatively:

question = input("What key would you like to look up?: ")

print(car[question])

try:
    print(car[question])
except:
    print("Key not in dictionary")
