Exercise: Factorial Calculator

Develop a Python program that computes the factorial of a given number entered by the user.

Requirements:

Ask the user to input a non-negative integer.
Check if the entered number is a non-negative integer. If not, prompt the user again until a valid input is provided.
Create a function named calculate_factorial that takes the entered number as an argument and computes its factorial.
Display the factorial of the entered number.
Remember: The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

Example Output:

mathematica
Copy code
Enter a non-negative integer: 5
Factorial of 5 is 120

Note: The Factorial of a whole number 'n' is defined as the product of that number with every whole number less than or equal to 'n' till 1.

number = int(input("Write a positive integer: "))

while number <= 0:
  number = input("The integer must be larger than 0:")

def factorial_creator(number):
  multiple = 1
  total = 1
  while multiple <= number:
    total = total * multiple
    multiple = multiple + 1
  return total

print(str(number) + "'s factorial is " + str(factorial_creator(number)))

import math

number = int(input("Write a positive integer: "))

while number <= 0:
  number = input("The integer must be larger than 0:")

def factorial_creator(number):
  return math.factorial(number)

print(str(number) + "'s factorial is " + str(factorial_creator(number)))

# With recursivity:

def factorial(x):
    if x == 1:
        return 1
    else: 
        return x * factorial(x-1)
