Exercise: Verbose Decorator

Create a Python program that uses a decorator to make a function print "Starting..." before executing the function and "Finished." 
after executing the function.

Requirements:

Define a decorator named verbose_decorator that prints "Starting..." before executing the function and "Finished." 
after executing the function.
Apply the verbose_decorator to a sample function.
The sample function could perform a simple task like printing a message or performing basic arithmetic operations.

Example Output:

Starting...
Function's output or action
Finished.

---

def verbose_decorator(func):
  def starting_finished():
    print("Starting. . .")
    func()
    print("Finished.")
  return starting_finished

@verbose_decorator
def odd_number_checker():
  number = int(input("Write a number: "))
  if number % 2 != 0:
    print("This number is odd.")
  else:
    print("This number is even.")

odd_number_checker()
