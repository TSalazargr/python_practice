We are improving our game and need to add an isAlive property, which returns True if the lives count is greater than 0.
Complete the code by adding the isAlive property.

The code uses a while loop to hit the Player, until its lives count becomes 0, using the isAlive property to make the condition.

---

class Player:
    def __init__(self, name, lives):
        self.name = name
        self._lives = lives

    def hit(self):
        self._lives -= 1

    @property
    def isAlive(self):
        if self._lives > 0:
            return True

p = Player("Cyberpunk77", int(input()))
i = 1
while True:
    p.hit()
    print("Hit # " + str(i))
    i += 1
    if not p.isAlive:
        print("Game Over")
        break
