Exercise: Prime Number Checker

Build a Python script that asks the user for a number and checks whether it is a prime number or not. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

Requirements:

Prompt the user to enter a positive integer greater than 1.
Check if the entered number is greater than 1 and an integer. If not, prompt the user again until a valid input is provided.
Create a function named is_prime that takes the entered number as an argument and returns True if it's a prime number and False otherwise.
Call the is_prime function with the user input and print whether the number is prime or not.

Example Output:

Enter a number greater than 1: 17
17 is a prime number.

number = int(input("Write an integer: "))

while number <= 2:
    number = int(input("The number must be larger than 2. Try again: "))

def prime_checker(number):
    prime_status = "This is a prime number."
    divider = 2
    while divider <= (number / 2):
        if number % divider == 0:
            prime_status = "This is not a prime number."
            break
        else:
            divider = divider + 1
    return prime_status

print(prime_checker(number))
