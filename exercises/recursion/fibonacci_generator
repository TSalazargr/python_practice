Exercise: Recursive Fibonacci Sequence

Create a Python program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number using recursion.

Requirements:

Define a function named fibonacci_recursive that uses recursion to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given limit.
Ask the user to input a positive integer that represents the maximum limit of the Fibonacci sequence.
Check if the entered number is a positive integer. If not, prompt the user again until a valid input is provided.
Use the fibonacci_recursive function to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the entered limit.
Display the Fibonacci sequence.
Remember: The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

Example Output:

vbnet
Copy code
Enter a positive integer as the limit: 10
Fibonacci sequence up to 10:
0 1 1 2 3 5 8

---

# Get user input for the length of the sequence
length = int(input("Enter the length of the Fibonacci sequence: "))

while length <= 0:
    print(input("Length should be a positive integer. Try again: "))

def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

def generate_fibonacci_sequence(length):
    sequence = []
    for i in range(length):
        sequence.append(fibonacci(i))
    return sequence

print("Fibonacci sequence of length", length, ":", generate_fibonacci_sequence(length))
