# f-strings or format strings

name = "Teresa"
age = 33
pronouns = "she/her"
print("This is {}, using {} pronouns, and is {} years old.".format(name, pronouns, str(age)))

LOCAL VARIABLES

# Local variables allow you to reuse variables and to put them in any order.
# There's no need to turn integers and floats into strings

name = "Teresa"
age = 33
pronouns = "she/her"
print("This is {name}, using {pronouns} pronouns, and is {age} years old. Hello {name}!".format(name=name, pronouns=pronouns, age=age))

Alternatively,

message = "This is {name}, using {pronouns} pronouns, and is {age} years old. Hello {name}!".format(name=name, pronouns=pronouns, age=age)

print(message)

---
#You can achieve the same result by starting the string with an "f"

name = "Teresa"
age = 33
pronouns = "she/her"
print(f"This is {name}, using {pronouns} pronouns, and is {age} years old.")
