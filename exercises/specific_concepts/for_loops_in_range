# range creates a list of number between either the first number (or the default (0) if there's only one number) and the second number

for counter in range(10):

# Usually programmers name the counter variable i, j or k in for loops, like this:

for i in range(5):
  print(i)

# However it's a good practice to name it something more obvious
