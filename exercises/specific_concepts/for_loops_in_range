# range creates a list of number between either the first number (or the default (0) if there's only one number) and the second number

for counter in range(10):
  print(counter) # Displays numbers 0 to 9 each in one line

print(counter) # Displays 9
---

for counter in range (5,10):
    print(counter) # Displays numbers 5 to 9 each in one line

# Usually programmers name the counter variable i, j or k in for loops, like this:

for i in range(5):
  print(i)

# However it's a good practice to name it something more obvious

total = 0

for number in range(100):
  total += number
  print(total)
