To retrieve each line in a file, you can use the 
readlines() method to return a list in which each element is a line in the file.

file = open("/usercode/files/books.txt")

for line in file.readlines():
    print(line)
    
file.close()

---

file.readlines() generates a list where each elements is a list

print(file.readlines()) # Displays ['Harry Potter\n', 'The Hunger Games\n', 'Pride and Prejudice\n', 'Gone with the Wind']

---

If you do not need to save for each line as an element in a list, you can simply iterate over the file variable:

file = open("/usercode/files/books.txt")

for line in file:
    print(line)
    
file.close()

In the output, the lines are separated by blank lines, 
as the print function automatically adds a new line at the end of its output.
