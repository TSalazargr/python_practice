Functional programming is a style of programming that (as the name suggests) is based around functions.

A key part of functional programming is higher-order functions. Higher-order functions take other functions as arguments, or return them as results.

def apply_twice(func, number):
    return func(func(number))

def add_five(x):
    return x + 5

print(apply_twice(add_five, 10))

This code defines a function apply_twice that takes two arguments:  func and number.  func is expected to be a function that takes one argument, and number is expected to be any value that can be passed to func. 

The apply_twice function first applies func to number, then applies func again to the result of the first application. The final result is returned. 

This is achieved by calling the func function twice by putting the function as one of the function's arguments.

The code also defines a function add_five that takes one argument and returns the argument plus 5. 

Finally, the code calls apply_twice with add_five as the func argument and 10 as the number argument. This means that the add_five function will be called twice with 10 as its argument, and the final result will be printed. In this case, the final result is 20.
