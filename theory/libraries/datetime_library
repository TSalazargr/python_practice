Your computer, like all others, uses the Unix epoch to track time. 
It starts counting seconds from Jan 1st, 1970, even when turned off, thanks to a small motherboard battery. 
It then translates this into a format humans can understand.

To use the Unix epoch, we first need to import the datetime library

import datetime

DATETIME.DATE()

The datetime.date() method returns a date object in the year-month-day format.

import datetime
  
myDate = datetime.date(year=2022, month=12, day= 7) # Values here must be integers
  
print(myDate) # This code outputs '2022-12-07'

For the datetime.date() method to work you must use the year -> month -> day format for your arguments. 
The order in which you input your arguments doesn't matter so long as you name then 'year', 'month' and 'day' are

Using this format makes sorting much easier.

DATETIME.DATE.TODAY()

This method tells you what day it is today.

import datetime
  
today = datetime.date.today()
  
print(today) # This code outputs the current date from your computer's clock.

DATETIME.TIMEDELTA()

Delta is a computer science term that means the difference between two things.

A time delta is a difference in time.

You can use the timedelta() method to add certain amount of time to a date.

Syntax : datetime.timedelta(days=0, seconds=0, microseconds=0, milliseconds=0, minutes=0, hours=0, weeks=0) 
Returns : Date

An example of this in use:

import datetime

today = datetime.date.today() # Today's date

print(today)

difference = datetime.timedelta(days=14) # The difference I want
new_date = today + difference # Add today to the delta difference to see the date in 14 days time.

print(new_date) 

one_week_later = datetime.timedelta(weeks=1)
new_date = new_date + one_week_later

print(new_date)

---

You can use ==, <, >, != comparators with dates.

import datetime

birthday = datetime.date(year=2023, month=12, day=30)

today = datetime.date.today()

if birthday == today:
  print("Happy 2023 birthday!")
elif birthday > today:
  print("It's not your birthday yet")
elif birthday < today:
  print("Your 2023 birthday passed.")
