Your computer, like all others, uses the Unix epoch to track time. 
It starts counting seconds from Jan 1st, 1970, even when turned off, thanks to a small motherboard battery. 
It then translates this into a format humans can understand.

To use the Unix epoch, we first need to import the datetime library

import datetime

DATETIME.DATE()

The datetime.date() method returns a date object in the year-month-day format.

import datetime
  
myDate = datetime.date(year=2022, month=12, day= 7) # Values here must be integers
  
print(myDate) # This code outputs '2022-12-07'

For the datetime.date() method to work you must use the year -> month -> day format (in that order) for your arguments. 

Using this format makes sorting much easier.

DATETIME.DATE.TODAY()

This method tells you what day it is today.

import datetime
  
today = datetime.date.today()
  
print(today) # This code outputs the current date from your computer's clock.
