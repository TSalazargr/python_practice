You are given a list of contacts, where each contact is represented by a tuple, with the name and age of the contact.
Complete the program to get a string as input, search for the name in the list of contacts and output the age of the contact in the format presented below:

Sample Input
John

Sample Output
John is 31

If the contact is not found, the program should output "Not Found".



contacts = [
    ('James', 42),
    ('Amy', 24),
    ('John', 31),
    ('Amanda', 63),
    ('Bob', 18)
]

name = input()

for x in contacts:
    if name in x:
        age = str(x[1])
        break
    else:
        age = "no name"

if age != "no name":
    print(name, "is", age)
else:
    print("Not Found")
